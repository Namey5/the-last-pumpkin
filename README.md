A top-down twin-stick zombie-survival game created in under 48 hours for [Kenney Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2022).

My plan was initially to have the zombies drop seeds, which you could then use to grow ammo pickups and even weapons. You can see the beginnings of some of those systems in there before I ultimately stripped them out to meet the deadline, but it could still be a fun idea.

Created in Unity 2021.3.1f1.
